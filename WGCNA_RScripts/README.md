## The scripts correspond with the next workflow:

**01_Healthy_SignedNtw_D.R**, R code used to build a signed-ntw with WGCNA for the healthy arabidopsis samples.  


**01_Infected_SignedNtw_E.R**, R code used to build a signed-ntw with WGCNA for the  treatments.

**02_Infected_GS_MM_24hpi.R**, R code used to explore, extract and compare the modules indentified in the signed-ntw with the treatments. Use pearson.

**02_Infected_GS_MM_24hpi_ward.R**, R code used to explore, extract and compare the modules indentified in the signed-ntw with the treatments. Use ward.
